I enjoy both art and science, which is why this field is so interesting to me. Creating something artistically expressive brings me just as much joy as learning how something intricate works. My mind is energized when faced with trying to figure out the inner workings of a complex system. Within the field of Web/Software Development I'm looking forward to continuing being a learner of how art and science intersect with each other.

                <p> Aside from Web/Software development, here are a few other facts about myself. I am from Alabama, and have a degree in the Humanities. I really enjoy art, dancing, board games, watching movies, traveling, and exploring new places.
